# Train Demo

Train Demo is a web application that simulates planning a trip and purchasing tickets for a train or bus ride. It uses real Amtrak data retrieved via a [FOIA request](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/machine-readable-amtrak-schedules-fares-and-stoproute-alignments-25904/). It is only partially implemented. The remaining features are left as an exercise.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SaffatHasan/se577-train-system.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SaffatHasan/se577-train-system)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.

2. Download the latest version of [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your OS. Install with the default options and remember the admin password you set.

3. Open pgAdmin 4 (this comes with Postgres) and create a new database called "TrainDemo".

4. Run `database/*.sql` (be sure to run `database/init_data.sql` last) on your new database. This populates the database with all the tables and data. The easiest way to run queries is with Query Tool (`Tools > Query Tool`) in pgAdmin 4.

5. Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your Postgres password. Make sure not to commit changes to this file to source control.

6. Add your GitHub `client-id` and `client-secret` to your `application.properties`. See the "Authentication" section.

7. Run the project in IntelliJ, Eclipse, or on the command line with
    ```
    mvnw clean package
    java -jar target/TrainDemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

8. Visit `localhost:8080` in a browser.

## Authentication

Authentication is performed using GitHub. For more info on how this works see [here](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/). You will have to add a new app to your GitHub account before you can run this application.

> To use GitHub’s OAuth 2.0 authentication system for login, you must first [Add a new GitHub app](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
> 
> Enter an app name and description. Then, enter your app’s home page, which should be http://localhost:8080, in this case. Finally, indicate the Authorization callback URL as http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github and click Register Application.
> 
> The OAuth redirect URI is the path in the application that the end-user’s user-agent is redirected back to after they have authenticated with GitHub and have granted access to the application on the Authorize application page.
 
Don't forget to set the `client-id` and `client-secret` in your `application.properites`. Do not commit these keys to source control. 

## Technology

Below are most of the technologies used in this project. This project intentionally has much of the same tech stack as Shopizer.

- Java - Most people know Java already. Using Java has the added benefit of allowing us to analyze our project with depends and DV8.

- Spring Boot - Spring Boot is a popular and opinionated web framework for Java.

- PostgreSQL - A robust, open-source relational database with excellent documentation.

- Hibernate - A full Object Relational Mapper (ORM). This is what powers our Repository pattern. (However, this kind of abstraction is not without it's issues. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch).)

- Thymeleaf - A modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments.

- Twitter Bootstrap - The current HTML index.html is written using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/)'s styling. Bootstrap is an easy way to create a professional looking website.

## Vocab

These are terms used in this project. The following come from our Amtrak data.

1. __Agency__ - An agency is an organization that provides transportation services. Usually this is just Amtrak.

2. __Stop__ - A stop, also called a station, is a physical location where someone enters or exits a train or bus.

3. __Trip__ - A trip is an ordered set of stops, each with an arriving and departing time. A trip also has a *calendar* which details which days of the week a trip is active on.

4. __Route__ - A route represents the physical tracks a train runs on. A route has many trips. In most cases, each of a route's trips have the same stops, but there is no guarantee of this. A route is operated by an agency.

5. __Segment__ - A subset of a Trip

To complete this application, you will have to introduce many new terms to describe concepts in your system. I suggest a few here.

5. __Connection__ - A connection connects two segments together at a specific stop. For example, to get from AAA to CCC, you may have to take a trip from AAA to BBB, then another from BBB to CCC. We would say you have a connection at BBB.

6. __Path__ - A path describes how a customer would actually get from stop A to B. So (at a minimum) a path would include a departure date and time, a set of trips, and a set of connections.

7. __Ticket__ - A ticket is what a customer uses to board the train. A customer may require many tickets if their path has many trips.

8. __Reservation__ - A reservation is what a customer actually pays for. It may include many tickets for many people.

## Design

In progress.
